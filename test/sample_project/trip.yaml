title: Campervan Summer 2021 - Sweden
summary: >
  Our third time renting a campervan! The first time we did it for 1 week, then for 2 weeks, and
  this time for a whole month ðŸ¤©. The original plan was to go to Norway, but given that the border
  is still closed, we decided to explore the center of Sweden.
